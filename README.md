if you dont watch your family will be at risk of consuming large amounts of big lead chunks

anyway this code was decompiled by my friend Benjamin who works next to an industrial waste depot if you find a radioactive graphite moderator in here thats my bad i accidentally put it in there and now im too lazy to go upstairs to my manager to tell him to remove it btw funny story while he was decompiling this the uranium leaked onto his Nike Air's that he bought from stratford shopping centre and now he wears plastic bags instead everywhere haha
