Full decompilation of Buckshot Roulette's source code.
All of the Dealer AI code is in DealerIntelligence.gd. The rest of the script files are self-explanatory.

Some functionality isn't implemented with GDScript (such as: the item limits) and is instead done with .tscn files which I will not be sharing here.
